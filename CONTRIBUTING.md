## Background

Destiny has several in game vendors that sell things, some are desired by the
players more than others, this bot aims to let them know when something good is
available.

## Developer Setup

Setup and use requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/),
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/), and a text editor such as
[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

This project is built for Node 8 and up but we develop using Node LTS and npm.
You can check your node version with `node -v` and your npm version with
`npm -v`.

If you're on a Mac, I'd suggest using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) for
installing the required software listed in Setup.

## Code Setup

Clone this project with Git to your prefered location.

## Configuration

For local development and testing, create a `.destiny-insights-bot.ini` file
your root folder. You'll need to Twitter API settings, you can get them
[here](https://apps.twitter.com/app/new).

Example:

```ini
twitterConsumerApiKey = "<twitterConsumerApiKey here>"
twitterConsumerSecret = "<twitterConsumerSecret here>"
twitterAccessToken = "<twitterAccessToken here>"
twitterAccessTokenSecret = "<twitterAccessTokenSecret here>"
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

This project follows the
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/)
specification to aid in automated releases and change log generation.
[Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint) is enabled
and ran as a `commit-msg` hook to enforce the commit format.
[Commitizen](http://commitizen.github.io/cz-cli/) can be used to prompt through
any requirements at commit time `npm run commit` (or `git cz` if Commitizen is
installed globally).

In short, if a commit will be fixing a bug, prefix the commit message with `fix:`

```sh
fix: my bug fix
```

```sh
feat: my new feature
```

Commits with `fix:` prefix will show up in the generated changelog as bullets
under the `Bug Fixes:` section, and `feat:` prefixed messages will show under
the `Features:` section. For more on the available prefixes/rules, see
[here](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/tree/master/%40commitlint/config-conventional#rules).
